The way to run the excel.py is, for example:

python ~/fd/excel.py ~/Desktop/janu/\*.xlsx

This will then run against all the files under ~/Desktop/janu which ends with xlsx and create a corresponding file .xlsx.xls which will have the output in the same directory

Running rename script is like this:

python ./rename.py -s a -e x.xlsx -d ~/Desktop/renamed -g '/Users/neelanshadwivedi/Desktop/2013/*/*.xlsx'

-s is for creating symlinks. Otherwise rename - not tested enough for rename flow
-e is extension to be used while creating symlinks/renamed files
-d is the directory name where to create symlinks
-g is the glob used to get all the files. glob is processed by python. to avoid the shell parsing it, use single quotes!
